Hey guys here is a little tutorial on how to use Egit.


First things first your going to need to setup your environment.
Please go into your home folder and delete your workspaces.
	(dont worry eclipse will create a new one for you).
	
Now follow the steps to setup your working directory.

1. File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git
2. Click ok if you get a popup then click Clone...
3. Fill out the form with the following data
	URI: git@github.com:mikedmor/nOOtepad.git
	Host: github.com
	Repository path: mikedmor/nOOtepad.git
	Protocol: <blank>
	Port: <blank>
	User: git
	Password: <blank>
4. Click next then in the next box put 'thecakeisalie' for the password
5. Click next, then Finish, Then Next
6. Make sure 'Import Existing Projects is selected then click next
7. Last Click Finish

Once you have that up you will have the full source working.
If you have an error stating 'Java Build Path Problems' and when you open
that you see 'Project 'nOOtepad' is missing required source folder.'gen', just
right click on that error and click "Quick Fix", when the box opens up click
finish, then check 'Android 3.2' Then clcik ok. That will fix the errors

There you go you have the source!
Here are a few extra tips you may want to know about using Egit.

To manage your data back to the git repository right click the file and go to Team

Team -> Add - Adds files to the current prject to be uploaded to Git
Team -> Commit - Commits your changes to the local git on your PC
	(be sure to commit as often as possible!)
Team -> Branch - Creates a switch between two different file version
Team -> Push - Pushes your changes in your local git (pc) to the remote git (online)
	(you should only push when you have gotten alot of work done)
	
This should be all that you need. Good luck! Looking forward to seeing this project working!
